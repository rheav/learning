# Remix - The Practical Guide

This repository contains the source code snapshots & slides used in my [Remix - The Practical Guide course](https://acad.link/remix).

# How To Use

The code snapshots are mainly intended for comparing your code to mine. You find multiple code snapshots for every course section in the `Code` folder.

The subfolder names are chosen such that they can easily be mapped to the course lectures.
